## Graph Colouring - Group 7

To easily navigate the project, you need a proper IDE.
We are using IntelliJ IDEA, so we will provide a mini tutorial for IDEA users.
It should work for Eclipse similarly.

For this project, we are using the Apache Commons Math package to compute
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. You can get the library here:
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi

It is also located in the 'lib' directory, which you have to add as a
library in your IDE.

In IntelliJ IDEA, make the 'graph-coloring' folder as a source folder,
'algorithm' directory has to be regarded as a package.
